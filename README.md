# TextLoom ✨

*Weaving AI text into natural human flow, powered by the Gemini API*

## 💬 The Problem

I rely heavily on AI language models for brainstorming, drafting, and summarizing. While they’re great at speed and structure, the outputs often feel **robotic** — lacking the rhythm, personality, and quirks of natural human writing.

When I searched for online “AI humanizers,” I ran into two big issues:

* **Expensive Subscriptions** → Most good tools are locked behind monthly paywalls.
* **Severe Character Limits** → Free versions barely allowed me to humanize a single paragraph.

That made them impractical for real-world use. I needed something:

✅ Free to run

✅ Capable of handling longer text

✅ Flexible enough to let me choose the tone

## ✨ The Solution

That’s why I built **TextLoom** — a local tool that transforms sterile AI text into **natural, engaging, human-like writing**.

* Uses the **Google Gemini API** through a Flask backend (keeping my API key safe).
* Runs as a **single-page web app**, lightweight and easy to use.
* No subscriptions. No limits. Just **reliable text humanization** whenever I need it.
